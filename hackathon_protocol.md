# The Code Arena: Hackathon Protocol

## ⚔️ The Combatants
- **Team Rust**: Fast, safe, and fearless.
- **Team Go**: The Google recruit, simple and efficient.

## 📜 The Rules of Engagement
1. **The Challenge**: Both teams must implement the same algorithm (e.g., Sorting, Pathfinding).
2. **The Arena**: A neutral Python judge (`arena_judge.py`) will execute the binaries.
3. **The Metric**: Execution time (wall clock).
4. **The Penalty**: The loser will be **disassembled**. Their binary code will be ripped apart and dumped into `shame.txt` for public mockery.

## 🏆 Victory Conditions
- The binary with the lowest execution time wins.
- In case of a tie, Go wins (Google bias).
